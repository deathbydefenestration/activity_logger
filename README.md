## Run Python Tests with Coverage:

In the `backend` directory, run `make`.

This will also set up the virtual environment.

## Run Python App:

1. Activate the virtual environment from the `backend/`, by running `source .venv3/bin/activate`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python app.py` (if your default Python version is not 3.x, you may need to specify `python3` instead)
